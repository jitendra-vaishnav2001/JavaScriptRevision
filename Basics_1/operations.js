//some operations 

    console.log(3+3+"3"+3);
    //In this case before the string value is added and after string value is not added include string value 
    console.log(3-"3"+13-"10");

    
    // string + number = concatenated string
    // number + number = the sum of both numbers
    // string - number = the difference between (coerced string) and the number

    // explanation:
    // If one or both operands is string, then the plus is considered as string concatenation operator rather than adding numbers.
    // the minus operator always try to convert both operands to numbers.

    // console.log(null >=0);
    // console.log(null>0);
    // console.log(null==0);
    // console.log(null<0);
    // console.log(null<=0);

    //this is beacuse equillity check == and comparison ><>= are work differntly they can't give us prditble result
